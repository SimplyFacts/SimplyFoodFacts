# **Privacy Policy**

Effective Date: March 1, 2026

Simply Food Facts ("we," "us," or "our") is a barcode scanning app that helps you view ingredient and nutritional information for food products. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## **1\. Information We Collect**

### **a) Data You Provide Through Use**

* Barcode scans — When you scan a product barcode, the barcode number and product name are recorded in your scan history.  
* Ingredient alerts — Custom ingredient alerts you create (e.g., "Aspartame," "Red 40") are stored so the app can flag those ingredients in future scans.

### **b) Data Stored on Your Device**

* App preferences — Settings such as font size and display options are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to our servers.

### **c) Camera Access**

The app requests access to your device's camera solely to scan product barcodes. Camera images are processed on-device in real time and are never captured, stored, or transmitted.

### **d) Data We Do Not Collect**

We do not collect or process any of the following:

* Names, email addresses, or account credentials  
* Location data  
* Device identifiers or advertising IDs  
* Health or medical data  
* Analytics or usage tracking beyond scan history  
* Photos or camera images

## **2\. How We Use Your Data**

* Scan history — To show you previously scanned products for easy reference.  
* Ingredient alerts — To flag matching ingredients when you view a product's details.

We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose other than providing the app's core features.

## **3\. In-App Purchases**

Simply Food Facts offers an optional Tip Jar feature that allows you to make voluntary, one-time in-app purchases to support the app's development.

### **a) Payment Processing**

All in-app purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information, credit card details, or billing address. All payment data is handled entirely by Apple in accordance with their privacy policies.

### **b) Purchase Records**

We use RevenueCat, a third-party purchase management service, to process and validate in-app purchases. RevenueCat may receive an anonymous identifier associated with your purchase to manage transaction records. No personal information is shared with RevenueCat.

### **c) What Tips Do Not Do**

* Tips do not unlock any additional features or content  
* Tips do not create an account or require personal information  
* Tips are entirely voluntary and are not required to use the app

## **4\. Third-Party Services**

### **Open Food Facts**

When you scan a barcode, the app may query the [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) API to retrieve product information (name, ingredients, allergens, nutritional data, and product images). Open Food Facts is a free, open, collaborative database. Only the barcode number is sent in the request. No personal data is shared with Open Food Facts.

### **RevenueCat**

We use RevenueCat to manage in-app purchase transactions. RevenueCat processes anonymous transaction data only. For more information, see [RevenueCat's privacy policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).

We do not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## **5\. Data Storage and Retention**

* Your data is stored on secure cloud-hosted databases within the United States.  
* Scan history and ingredient alerts are stored in a secure database.  
* Scan history records older than 30 days are automatically deleted.  
* You can manually delete all scan history or all ingredient alerts at any time from the app's Settings screen.  
* App preferences (font size, display toggles) are stored only on your device and can be cleared by uninstalling the app.  
* In-app purchase transaction records are managed by Apple and RevenueCat. We do not store purchase history on our servers.

## **6\. Data Sharing**

We do not sell, rent, trade, or share your data with any third parties. The only external communications are the barcode lookup request sent to Open Food Facts (which contains no personal information) and anonymous purchase validation through RevenueCat.

## **7\. Your Rights and Choices**

* Delete scan history — Use the "Clear Scan History" option in Settings to permanently remove all scan records.  
* Delete ingredient alerts — Use the "Clear All Alerts" option in Settings to permanently remove all saved alerts.  
* Camera access — You can revoke camera permission at any time through your device's system settings.  
* In-app purchases — You can manage or request refunds for purchases through the App Store.  
* Uninstall — Removing the app from your device will delete all locally stored preferences.

## **8\. Children's Privacy**

Simply Food Facts is not directed at children under the age of 13\. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. The app does not require account creation and does not collect any personal identifiers.

## **9\. Security**

We use industry-standard measures to protect the data stored in our database. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## **10\. Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Your continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
