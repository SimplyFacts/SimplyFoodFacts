# Simply Food Facts  
**Privacy Policy**  
**Effective Date: February 27, 2026**

Simply Food Facts ("we," "us," or "our") is a barcode scanning app that helps you view ingredient and nutritional information for food products. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## 1. Information We Collect

### a) Data You Provide Through Use
- **Barcode scans** — When you scan a product barcode, the barcode number and product name are recorded in your scan history.
- **Ingredient alerts** — Custom ingredient alerts you create (e.g., "Aspartame," "Red 40") are stored so the app can flag those ingredients in future scans.

### b) Data Stored on Your Device
- **App preferences** — Settings such as font size and display options are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to our servers.

### c) Camera Access
The app requests access to your device's camera solely to scan product barcodes. Camera images are processed on-device in real time and are never captured, stored, or transmitted.

### d) Data We Do Not Collect
We do not collect or process:
- Names, email addresses, or account credentials  
- Location data  
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs  
- Health or medical data  
- Analytics or usage tracking beyond scan history  
- Photos or camera images  

## 2. How We Use Your Data
- **Scan history** — To show you previously scanned products for easy reference.  
- **Ingredient alerts** — To flag matching ingredients when you view a product's details.  

We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose other than providing the app's core features.

## 3. Third-Party Services

### Open Food Facts
When you scan a barcode, the app may query the Open Food Facts API to retrieve product information (name, ingredients, allergens, nutritional data, and product images). Only the barcode number is sent in the request. No personal data is shared with Open Food Facts.

We do not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## 4. Data Storage and Retention
- Scan history and ingredient alerts are stored in a secure database.  
- Scan history older than 30 days is automatically deleted.  
- You can manually delete all scan history or ingredient alerts at any time in Settings.  
- App preferences are stored only on your device and are removed when you uninstall the app.

## 5. Data Sharing
We do not sell, rent, trade, or share your data with any third parties. The only external communication is the barcode lookup request sent to Open Food Facts, which contains no personal information.

## 6. Your Rights and Choices
- **Delete scan history** — Use “Clear Scan History” in Settings.  
- **Delete ingredient alerts** — Use “Clear All Alerts” in Settings.  
- **Camera access** — You can revoke permission in system settings.  
- **Uninstall** — Removing the app deletes all locally stored preferences.

## 7. Children's Privacy
Simply Food Facts is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. The app does not require account creation and does not collect personal identifiers.

## 8. Security
We use industry-standard measures to protect stored data. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Effective Date.” Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance.
